# Kiwi-Campus-Challenge
The challenge consists of a guide on ROS (Robotics operating system) that engineers of Kiwi Campus Inc have done with a lot of detail, there you will have to solve step by step simulations, programming tasks and deployment of environments (packages) to complete the challenge.
